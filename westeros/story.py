A grave concern has arisen from the castle's residents! They speak of a foul and ominous stink wafting from the King's garden (AKA backyard).  
Could it be the work of our mischievous bandits, or perhaps something far more sinister?  
The King implores you to investigate this unsavory matter and restore a breath of fresh air to his beloved domain! 
        
Before we embark on our quest, a matter of royal urgency must be attended to.  
A grand shipment of the finest silken scrolls—known in simpler terms as toilet paper—has arrived at the castle gates.  
The King requests your aid in unloading this precious cargo and delivering a portion to his private chambers.  
Do not tarry, for the King's comfort is of utmost importance!\n\n"""

Hmmm... Missing?

It must be the dastardly SPS! I am certain of it! Such vile cruelty knows no bounds.  
Make haste, brave traveler, and venture to the King's grand garden—known to some as the backyard.  
The foul stench is surely their doing, and it demands swift action. Find how they broke in! 
Investigate the source of this odious offense and return posthaste!\n\n
"""

    task_3 = """\n\n
Poop, you say? By the King's crown, even the foulest of creatures could not conjure waste of such hideous stench!  
The Shadowpaws Syndicate has plagued our kingdom for years, yet never have their misdeeds led to such an overwhelming outcry. Why now?  

My loyal subjects, the truth must be uncovered! Venture into the garden with haste and investigate what the SPS may have feasted upon.  
Search the trees, plants, and all manner of foliage for anything unusual.\n\n"""

    task_4 = """\n\n
Tree you say? Perhaps the SPS do not know what is food and what is not. Eating this gold
has caused them to poop themselves silly! 

Yet still...   A tree?

Take to royal tree and look around for anything of interest. Report back quick!
\n\n"""

A faberge egg from the royal treasury (AKA pantry)! How could it have been breached!

Whispers from the Kingsguard speak of a green creature lurking near the treasury.

Go to the treasury at once and see what you find!

These rascals, led by four raccoons, a sneaky possum, and three nimble cats, have 
raided the royal granary, stolen precious gems from the treasury, and even snuck 
into the kitchens to pilfer the King's favorite pies! Their antics have left the

A green dragon, you say? Preposterous! Surely, this reeks of the Shadowpaws Syndicate's handiwork.  
Their cunning ways and expanding network of accomplices grow bolder by the day!  

The King rises from his throne, his robes shimmering in the torchlight. With a gracious nod, he declares:  

"You have served me well, my loyal subjects. Mmm, yes... I shall award you the gold you so valiantly reclaimed."  

Congratulations, brave travelers. You have saved the treasury and earned your reward.  

But beware—this battle is far from over. The Shadowpaws Syndicate remains a threat,  
and we may call upon your courage and wit again in the future. Until then, enjoy your well-deserved rest!"
